# nostr-bech32
bech32.php and convert.php with functions for converting nostr npubs to hex and vice versa

Working to convert npubs to hex. However there is a problem converting hex back to npub.
The convert.php already has the function and button but it is commented out because it is not working.

Just copy the files to your server and convert your npubs.
